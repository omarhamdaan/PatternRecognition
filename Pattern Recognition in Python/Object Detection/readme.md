# Object Detection with YOLOv3

This section of the repository focuses on object detection using YOLOv3, one of the most effective object detection algorithms. To get started, you'll need the YOLOv3 weights, the COCO names file, and the YOLOv3 configuration file. Below are the links to download each of these components.

## Prerequisites

Before running the YOLOv3 model, ensure you have the following files:

1. **YOLOv3 Weights**: The pre-trained model weights on the COCO dataset.
2. **COCO Names**: A list of the class names that YOLOv3 can detect.
3. **YOLOv3 Configuration (cfg)**: The configuration file that describes the network architecture.

- **YOLOv3 Config File**: [Download Here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)

## Setup Instructions

To use YOLOv3 for object detection, follow these steps:

1. Download the YOLOv3 weights, COCO names, and cfg files from the links provided above.
2. Place these files in the appropriate directory in your project (e.g., `/Object Detection/yolov3`).
3. Use the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks to load the YOLOv3 model with these files.
4. Run the object detection model on your images or video streams.
